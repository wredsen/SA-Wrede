Most Jupyter Notebooks rely on a Fork of https://github.com/TUD-RST/symbtools.

For execution [this Fork](https://github.com/wredsen/symbtools) is assumed to be cloned and checked out on <code>DAE_statefeedback</code> in the same parent directory as this repository.

## Relevant Content:
* single_crane_notebooks: ODE and DAE simulation of a single crane gantry system
* double_crane_notebooks: DAE simulation of a double crane gantry system coupled by a common load
* flatness_notebooks: ODE modelling of the double crane gantry system, flatness analysis, trajectory planning and control, simulation
